#GAM101 Grip Controller Project

Welcome to the repository for my GAM101 Grip Controller Project! This project features a custom controller that uses a hand strength exerciser, a bend sensor, and LEDs, all powered by an Arduino Uno.

As part of this project, I designed my first custom PCB in EasyEDA, combining hardware and software to create a functional and interactive system.

This repository contains everything you need to explore or replicate the project, including schematics, code, and documentation. Whether you're into Arduino projects or PCB design, this project is a great starting point!
